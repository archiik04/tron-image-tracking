# 🌀 Tron-Themed AR Web Experience  
*A Tron-themed image-tracking AR built to promote MLSA events and increase attendee registrations.*



## Overview

This project is a **Tron-themed Augmented Reality (AR) web experience** built using **A-Frame** and **MindAR**. Designed with a **cyberpunk-inspired user interface**, the experience incorporates glowing neon effects, animated visual elements, and an interactive AR scene.

It leverages **WebXR** technologies to create a lightweight and immersive browser-based AR experience that helps **engage users, promote tech events**, and **encourage registrations** through interactive visuals.


## Features

- Image-tracking AR using MindAR
- 3D model rendering (`jet.glb`)
- Event soundtrack (optional music integration)
- Cyberpunk-style visual effects (hex grid, floating particles, neon trails)
- Integrated social media and registration buttons
- Live Giphy animations for added energy and style
- Custom marker-based 3D content reveal

4. **Scan the marker** from your phone or an AR-supported browser. Allow camera access.


## What Happens

* A neon-themed home screen animates into view.
* Users scan the event marker image.
* A 3D Tron-style jet model appears through AR.
* Interactive icons lead to social media and event registration.
* Floating visuals and ambient music enhance the vibe.


## Notes

* Use a mobile device or AR-compatible browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
* Good lighting helps with accurate image tracking.
* All assets (model, marker, text) can be modified for your own event theme.


## Future Additions

* Animated interactions with the model
* Countdown timer for event launch
* RSVP form integration
* Leaderboard or reward tracking through AR
